# Frequently Assigned Quorum

## Is däμbenscrypt a language or a framework (compare: React vs. Svelte)?

No no. däμbenscrypt is neither of that. Rather, it's a mindset. A meme.  Often,
we developers are asked: But does it scale? Is it secure? Is it
production-ready. To those I say, is a pupating butterfly production-ready?  Is
it alive or dead? That's däμbenscrypt. It's a pupating Schrödinger's butterfly.
You're welcome.
