# Frequently Assigned Quorum

## Is däμbenscrypt a language or a framework (compare: React vs. Svelte)?

No no. däμbenscrypt is neither of that. Rather, it's a mindset. A meme.  Often,
we developers are asked: But does it scale? Is it secure? Is it
production-ready. To those I say, is a pupating butterfly production-ready?  Is
it alive or dead? That's däμbenscrypt. It's a pupating Schrödinger's butterfly.
You're welcome.

## I'm a representative with the Oracle Java VM foundation and would like to make an acquisition offer. How can I contact you?

Yes.

## Is däμbenscrypt turing-complete?

At this moment, we **don't** recommend taking däμbenscrypt on any kind of tours (bicycle-tours, car-tours, parcours, etc.).
